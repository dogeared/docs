= Project Setup

In this tutorial, you can choose to implement the user interface of the chat application using either Java and Flow, or TypeScript, React and Hilla. In traditional web apps, you often run into the concepts _frontend_ and _backend_. Frontend code runs in the browser, backend code on the server. In addition, the frontend is often synonymous with the user interface, whereas the backend is "everything else", such as business logic, application services, REST APIs, etc.

In a Vaadin app, things are a little different. Flow allows you to write user interfaces using Java only, which means that a big part of your user interface is actually running on the server - the backend. There is also a frontend runtime, but you don't have to touch it unless you want to.

Hilla, on the other hand, follows the more traditional approach where the user interface runs solely in the browser. The follwing graphic illustrates this differece:

In a Vaadin application it makes more sense to talk about _presentation layer_ and _application layer_ rather than frontend and backend. These terms are _conceptual layers_ that define where a piece of code belongs conceptually rather than physically. They also don't have anything to do with layered architectures.

In a Flow app, the presentation layer has parts that run in the browser and parts that run on the server. In a Hilla app, the presentation layer runs only in the browser. The application layer is the same for both cases. It is even possible to combine Hilla and Flow in the same app. This is called a _hybrid app_, but it is outside the scope of this tutorial.

== Architecture

// TODO Describe the architecture of the application we are going to build

== Download the Starter

In this tutorial, the focus is going to be on the presentation layer only. Therefore, a starter project with a complete application layer has been created for you. It is a Maven-project compressed as a zip-file that you can download https://github.com/peholmst-sandbox/unified-tutorial/releases/download/latest-starter/unified-chat-tutorial-starter.zip:[here].

Once you have downloaded it, uncompress it and open it in your favorite Java IDE. In IntelliJ IDEA, the project looks like this:

// TODO Continue here to explain the file structure and how it relates to the architecture

You are now ready to get started! If you want to learn how to build the chat user interface in Java using Flow, click <<flow,here>>.

If you want to learn how to build the chat user interface in TypeScript using Hilla and React, click <<hilla,here>>.

If you want to learn both, just go through this tutorial twice!
