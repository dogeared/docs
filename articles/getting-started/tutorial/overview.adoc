.Work in progress
[IMPORTANT]
This tutorial is still being written. Its content is already useful, but some parts are missing.

This tutorial demonstrates how to develop applications in Vaadin Flow and Hilla: you can read and work through both, or focus on the one you prefer based on your needs and background. Since it's written for newcomers to Vaadin Flow and Hilla, it might be worthwhile to go through both.

For those who choose only the Flow part of this tutorial, it's assumed that the reader has some Java experience, if not necessarily experience with developing Java web applications. Along those lines, it's also assumed that the reader has a basic understanding of how to develop applications using the Spring Boot open-source Java framework. This includes understanding Spring bean, the Spring lifecycle, and scope. Of course, a background in developing Java applications for the web would make it much easier to follow this tutorial.

For understanding and getting the most from the Hilla part of this tutorial, in addition to the skills and experience expected for understanding the Flow section, the reader should also have basic skills in React, the open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components.


== Learning Tasks & Concepts

In this tutorial, which is spread over several pages here, you'll build a simple application and deploy it. The same application will be developed in both Flow and Hilla. For each, it'll be a chat application, using the same backend -- demonstrating the similarities and differences. The results will look and behave the same, but will be implemented differently, from a different development prospective. 

The finished application will look like what you see in this screenshot:

== Prerequisites

This tutorial uses Java 21. Vaadin works with Java 17, but to be able to use the latest features of the latest Java LTS (long term support) release, you'll use version 21.

To get most of what you need, download a starter package file, which contains an entire Maven project.

As for tools, you'll use a web browser, maven, and a Java IDEE of your choice (e.g., IntelliJ, VS Code).


== Key Concepts

Several concepts key for Vaadin will be explored and higlighted in this tutorial: views, routing, layout, server push, backend integration, and security. 

View:: 
A view is an application's user interface page, or rather a composite of text, images, interactive components, and other elements the user may view and with which the user may interact.

Routing::
This is the mapping of views to different URL paths. Navigating to a different view inside an application changes the URL path -- which can contain path parameters.

// RUSSELL: need text for each concept below.
Layout::
Text describing layout.

Server Push::
Text describing server push.

Backend Integration::
Text describing backend integration.

Security::
Text describing security.
